## Introduction

### Goal
Predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using unsupervised learning: K-Means clustering and PCA, specifically.

### Repository Structure
The root directory contains:
- The source code: [Crypto_Clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/alyssahondrade/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Crypto_Clustering.ipynb)
- The helper functions: [helper_functions.ipynb](https://github.com/alyssahondrade/CryptoClustering/blob/main/helper_functions.ipynb)

The `Resources` subdirectory contains the raw dataset.

The `Images` subdirectory contains images used in the README.

### Dataset
The dataset was generated by **edX Boot Camps LLC**.


## Approach
1. Prepare the data.
    - Use `StandardScaler()` to normalise the data.
    - Create a DataFrame with the scaled data, with the crypto name as the index.

2. Find the best value for `k` using the original data.
    - Use the helper function `elbow_curve()` to plot the curve.
    - Assign the plot to a variable to reuse later (DRY Principles).

3. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original data.
    - Use the helper function `kmeans_cluster()` to get the DataFrame with the clusters column.
    - Create a scatter plot and assign to a variable (as above).

4. Optimise clusters with Principal Component Analysis.
    - Create a PCA model with 3 principal components.
    - Calculate the total and explained variance.
    - Create a DataFrame with the calculated PC values.

5. Find the best value for `k` using the PCA data: As with Step 2.

6. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data: As with Step 3.

7. Visualise and compare the results.
    - Create a composite plot of the elbow curves using the (+) operator.
    - Create another composite plot of the elbow curves, overlaying each curve in a single plot for better comparison.
    - Create a composite plot to contrast the clusters using the (+) operator.


## Analysis
__What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?__

|Comparison of K-Means Clustering - Original vs PCA Data|

1. The overlayed elbow curve demonstrates that using the PCA data (fewer features) results in an overall lower inertia. This is demonstrated by the red curve (PCA data) shifted down compared to the blue curve (Original data).


2. Given the same number of clusters, fewer features result in an improved segmentation. This is evident in the PCA Clustering plot, wherein the data points are clustered closer with less overlaps compared to the Original Clustering plot.


In conclusion, it is possible to achieve improved clustering with fewer features given the chosen features capture a high percentage of the original dataset's variability - by removing features which contribute more noise than structure.
